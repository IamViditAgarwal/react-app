# TodoList App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This App is the first in the series of small project that I will build during the learning process of the react. These mini projects will be fully functional. I will also deploy these on different platforms like the heroku or the netlify.

## Run locally
